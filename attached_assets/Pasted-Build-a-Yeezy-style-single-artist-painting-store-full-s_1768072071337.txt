Build a Yeezy-style single-artist painting store (full stack, production-ready)
You are a senior full-stack engineer + product architect. Build a production-ready web app called StudioDrop: a minimalist, high-end storefront inspired by Yeezy.com’s clean “drop” aesthetic, but selling one artist’s paintings and prints. This is not a marketplace. There is one official artist/brand and only the admin can add/edit artworks, drops, and content. Deliver the entire system: frontend, backend, database, admin, payments, shipping, SEO, security, tests, and deployment.
1) Roles & access
* Guest: browse, search, view artwork details.
* Customer: account (optional), wishlist, cart, checkout, order history, addresses.
* Admin (you): full control of artworks, images, pricing, drops, CMS blocks, orders, refunds.
No artist signup, no multi-vendor payouts.
2) UX & pages (Yeezy-like)
Design: premium minimal, monochrome, big imagery, whitespace, fast transitions, mobile-first. Pages:
* Home: featured drop/collection, “new works”, editorial sections.
* Drop/Collection: hero + countdown + grid + sold-out states.
* Artwork detail: zoom gallery, dimensions, medium, year, authenticity info, shipping estimate, add-to-cart.
* Search & filters: price, size (height/width ranges), medium, style tags, availability, color tags.
* Cart + Checkout: shipping, tax, discount codes, payment.
* Account (optional): orders, addresses, wishlist.
* Static pages: About, Contact, Shipping/Returns, Privacy, Terms.
3) Admin panel (must be excellent)
Admin-only dashboard with:
* Create/edit artworks (all fields below)
* Upload/manage images (reorder, set cover, generate thumbnails)
* Create/schedule drops (start/end time, featured drop, countdown behavior)
* Manage inventory & sold-out logic
* Order management (status updates, shipping labels/tracking, refunds)
* CMS blocks for homepage + editorial sections (rich text + images)
* Customer emails / drop waitlist export
* Audit log of admin actions
4) Artwork requirements (painting-specific)
Each artwork supports:
* Title, description, year
* Type: original painting / limited print / open edition
* Medium (oil, acrylic, watercolor, mixed), surface (canvas/paper/wood), style tags
* Dimensions: height, width, depth + unit (in/cm)
* Framed/unframed + frame details (optional)
* Weight + packaging notes
* Inventory rules:
    * Original: qty = 1
    * Limited print: edition size + remaining quantity
    * Open edition: unlimited (or admin-defined cap)
* Pricing:
    * price, compare-at price, currency
    * optional “installment” plan (define policy clearly)
* Authenticity:
    * certificate of authenticity (PDF upload)
    * provenance notes (optional)
* Shipping:
    * shipping class (small/medium/oversize)
    * insurance required toggle
    * local pickup option toggle
Media:
* multiple images, optional video
* automatic compression + thumbnails + CDN delivery
5) Drops/collections (core feature)
* Admin can schedule a drop with start time (and optional end time).
* Before drop: show countdown; lock purchasing until drop opens.
* During drop: allow purchase; update inventory in real-time.
* Inventory decrement must be atomic (no oversell).
* Sold-out state and optional waitlist signup (email capture).
6) Payments, orders, shipping, tax
* Payments: Stripe Checkout or Payment Intents with Apple Pay/Google Pay.
* Stripe webhooks: verified signatures + idempotency.
* Orders: pending, paid, processing, shipped, delivered, canceled, refunded, returned.
* Refunds: full/partial from admin panel.
* Shipping calculation:
    * rules based on size/weight/shipping class + destination
    * allow manual override for oversize pieces
* Taxes: integrate Stripe Tax (preferred) or a tax provider.
Emails:
* order confirmation
* shipping/tracking email
* drop waitlist notify (manual or scheduled)
